# CCS-Coding-Community

Hello all,
Welcome to the official Github repository of CCS Coding Community which is an initiative by Creative Computing Society to boost the coding culture at TIET. With a community of 1800+ members, 7 proficient mentors and 60+ questions discussed till date,CCS Coding Community is one of the best places to kickstart your DSA journey. At Coding Community,we daily share 2 questions - 1 basic(for those who are just getting started) and 1 advanced(for those who have some knowledge of DSA) and at the end of the day, the solutions are discussed and explained by a mentor on a meet.
